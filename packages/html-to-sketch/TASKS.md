# Release push checklist
Tracking https://gard.telekom.de/gardwiki/display/DTDS/2021+Sketch+File+Progress
    - ( ) Ping new Sketch file & feedback to Anna every afternoon

    - [x] Naming "Default" -> "Standard"
    - [x] Breadcrumb

        - [x] Small button icon size
        - [x] Secondary large button is 42x40, should be 40x40
            - Broken in component style (border 1, padding 8, width 24 => 1+1 + 8+8 + 24 = 42)
            - Workaround: make icon size 22
            - Ditto for secondary small button 34x32
    - [z] Checkbox
        - [x] error state need error message
        - [ ] disable states should have the same font color (#D0D0D0)

    - [ ] Card
        - [ ] Use new component
    - [ ] Dropdown
        - [x] Select Box renamed to Dropdown
        - [ ] should have fixed height/width and spacing
        - [ ] different symbol naming structure, no open dropdown symbol existing
        - [ ] pressed states should have an open dropdown, solid icon and (except the error state) a magenta pressed outline (#CB0068)
    - [ ] Progress bar
        - [x] progress bar filling needs corner roundings
        - [x] progress bar needs counter with percentage 
        - [ ] should have fixed height/width and spacing
        - [ ] naming sketch files + storybook need to be aligned
    - [ ] Switch
        - [z] label inside switch should change color as well in hover/active  states
        - [x] artboards too large
        - [ ] should have fixed height/width and spacing
        - [ ] different symbol naming

    - [ ] Textarea
        - [ ] textarea scroll is three times in there
        - [ ] textarea resizable and expand missing
        - [ ] should have fixed height/width and spacing
        - [ ] naming sketch files + storybook need to be aligned (default vs standard etc.)
    - [ ] Text field
        - [x] Rename "Input field" to "Text field"

# Style overrides
    - [x] Color styles to change icon colors
        const sharedStyles = [
            new SharedStyle({
                id: "white-shared-style",

            })
        ];
        sharedStyles.map(sharedStyle => sketch.addLayerStyle(sharedStyle));
        - Shared styles are in document.json

# Port sketch-to-html models over to sketch-constructor
    [] Make sketch-constructor models that work in the browser
    [] Translate API in nodeToSketch files
    [] Both libs to use the same models

    [] Figure out what components not to make resizable (hint, tip: specified width and/or height)
        [] Pass CSS layout info from html-to-sketch
    [] Translate flexbox rules to constraints 
        [] layout direction
        [] justify
        [] auto margins

    layer.setResizingConstraint(resizingConstraintValues.top, resizingConstraintValues.left); // Return 27 (31 & 59)

            "minSize": 0
        }

# Images
    - [] SVG
        - PDFs can be embedded
        - svg-to-pdfkit...
    - [x] Download images https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52542149/how-can-i-download-images-on-a-page-using-puppeteer
    - [x] Inject images into Sketch document - asketch.json has bitmap entries, turn them into sketch-constructor
        new Bitmap({
            filePath: '/local/path.png',
            frame,
            style
        })
    - [x] IMG
    - [x] Images in CSS
        - [x] url()
        - [x] data:
        - [x] content
    - [x] Cross-origin images
    - [x] Formats
        - [x] PNG
        - [x] JPG

# Smoke test using whatever websites in inject.js

# Make a new branch for adding layout constraints, pseudo elements
    [x] :after and :before pseudo elements
    [x] :-webkit-slider-thumb and friends
    [x] -webkit-slider-track

# Nested symbols

- [x] Agent states - compare if has :hover, :focus, :active etc
    - [x] Generate state variant elements
    - [x] getComputedStyle with :foo
    - [x] Create variant names with :foo
    - Doesn't work, since getComputedStyle doesn't do :hover
    - There's a way to do it via Puppeteer https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4057
    - [x] Shadow root handling for states
        - Can't get it working correctly
        - Ignore Shadow DOM, scale is deprecating it
    - [x] Investigate once more if we can programmatically do them
    - [x] Add :focus
    - [x] Add :active                  
- [x] Symbol names
    - [x] No crazy /null/0
    - [x] If param value long, just remove it
- [x] Override - parse layer name
    - Use layer name as prefix to override style name
    - Deal with instance creation failure
- [x] Create new symbol if frame differs
- [x] Accurate rendering or fewer symbols?
    - Accurate
- [x] Always use node names
- [x] Replace system fonts
- [x] Debug duplicate text styles
    - [x] Instead of name = variant, name = symbol / variant
- [x] Symbol Master text styles should use variant name if symbol master has one.

# Components tests

- [x] Use document as Sketch library
    - [x] Stable document ID
    - [x] Stable symbol IDs
    - [x] Bump symbol changeIdentifier on build

- [x] Better Sketch library stability
    - [x] Store document ID in symbol map
    - [x] Pass in symbol map filename
    - [x] Use Sqlite DB as symbol map
    - [x] Allow renaming symbols
        - [x] Use a stable symbol key for components instead of symbol name
        - [x] symbolKey -> symbolID -map
        - [x] Default symbolKey to symbol name
        - [x] Fix symbol renaming
            - Symbols in dropdown update name on Library update
            - Document layer names aren't updated on Library update (You need an extension for that (e.g. symbol instance renamer))

- [x] Propagate :hover states through Shadow DOM (including slot content)

- [x] Handle slot content better (copying the content tree under the slot element breaks styles, materializing the styles breaks the stylesheet overrides as style attribute takes precedence)
    - Slot content is now traversed similarly to shadow roots

- [ ] SVG styles shouldn't be materialized to DOM

- [x] Group layout should be applied to the first child as well (axis 0 layoutAnchor 1)

- [ ] groupLayout messes up some symbols, in some it works fine
    - Messed up
        - [x] Input field - actually this is fine, it should have a fixed size...
        - [ ] Textarea
        - [ ] Select box
        - [ ] Icons (stretched icon override)
    - Works fine
        - Button
        - Tag
        - Checkbox
        - Radio button
    - Looks as usual
        - Breadcrumb
        - Links
        - Accordion
        - Modal
        - Slider
        - Switch
        - Card

- [ ] Create text inside empty input and textarea
- [ ] Input label and placeholder
- [ ] List ordinals
- [ ] List bullets

- [ ] Button sizing wrong due to center aligned text
- [ ] Button symbols have 1px outline, messing up the size
- [ ] Icons not linked (still two groups of icons)
- [ ] Icons don't take color of buttons if I switch them
