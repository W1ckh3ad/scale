Select Insert → Symbols, find the Scale sketch library, and hover over it. Then you will see a list of all components. Move the mouse to a component to display further variants and states. After making your selection, simply drag the corresponding component onto your artboard.

To do so, click on the corresponding icon in the top left or select the Components view in the main navigation via View/Components. Now all components will appear in the left sidebar. Right-click on a component or select Insert Symbol in the right sidebar to add the components to your artboard.


### Component usage
