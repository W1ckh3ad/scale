# FAQ

Here is a list of Questions we often get asked and the best answers we have.

## Why is all documentation written for VUE.js? What about react, angular and plain web components?

The web components work for all of the mentioned Frameworks. For this beta, we focused on VUE.js first and will deliver the additional documentation over time. If you have immediate need, please let us know.

## When can I use web components?

Web components are compatible with all modern browsers. Backward compatible through polyfills. Refer to [webcomponents.org](https://webcomponents.org) for more information.

## We have our own design system, why not use that?

There are several Design Systems on project level serving project requirements. Scale considers the requirements on an enterprise level. While you can probably use your own system in parallel with Scale, we recommend you use a custom theme for Scale and add your own components where needed.

Using Scale is currently voluntary. We work hard to provide access to everyone who needs it.

## How often will you release updates to the design system?
