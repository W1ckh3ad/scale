# FAQ

Here is a list of questions we are asked often, along with our best answers.

## Why is all documentation written for VUE.js? What about React, Angular and plain web components?

The web components work for all of the mentioned frameworks. For this beta version, we have focused on VUE.js first and will deliver the additional documentation over time. If you need anything urgently, please <LinkTo kind="community-your-feedback">let us know.</LinkTo>

## When can I use web components?

Web components are compatible with all modern browsers. Backward compatible through polyfills. Refer to [webcomponents.org](https://webcomponents.org) for more information.

## The component I need is not part of Scale right now, what do I do?

<LinkTo kind="community-your-feedback">Talk to us</LinkTo>. We might be able to
prioritize your requirements. We are delighted if you decide to <LinkTo kind="community-contributing-to-scale">contribute.</LinkTo>

## A component I want to use does not meet my specific requirements.?

You can always fork any of our components and improve it. If meeting your requirements can benefit everyone, we would love for you to <LinkTo kind="community-contributing-to-scale">contribute.</LinkTo>

## I have an Idea for Scale, what now?

## Can I use Scale with software other than Sketch?

We are currently primarily supporting Sketch. If you want to add support for e.g. Figma or Framer X, we are looking forward to your <LinkTo kind="community-contributing-to-scale">contribution.</LinkTo>

## We have our own design system, why not use that?

There are several design systems on project level serving project requirements, whereas Scale considers the requirements at an enterprise level. While you can probably use your own system in parallel with Scale, we recommend you use a custom theme for Scale and add your own components where needed.

## Something is broken.

Please report <LinkTo kind="community-your-feedback">bugs here.</LinkTo>

My design team is partially at an agency. Do they have to use the system as well?

Using Scale is currently voluntary. We work hard to provide access to everyone who needs it.

## How often will you release updates to the design system?

We are planning for regular iterations, bugfixes and feature releases.

## What's your timeline?

Milestones include:

Closed Beta Q3 2020

Official Release Q4 2020 or later.
