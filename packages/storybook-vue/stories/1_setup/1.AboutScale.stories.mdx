![About Scale](/assets/About-Scale.png)

Scale Design System is a new way for teams to design, prototype and build products.

## Production ready UI components for design and development

Scale provides matching Design Assets and Frontend Code Components. This makes collaboration between Design and development much smoother and frees up considerable resources in a product design process.

## Always in sync

Scales Design Assets and Code Components are based on a single source of truth so they are always in sync and up to date. Using the provided standard theme, the visual design is approved by Brand and Design.

## Production ready on all Frameworks

Scales Design Assets are built to work in Sketch, the code Components can be used in major frontend Frameworks like Vue, React and Angular. The Code Components can also be used as "vanilla" web components. [Learn more about Web Components](#).

## Enabling best of class experiences

Scale helps save time in UI Design, Brand Alignment, Design Hand-off, Prototyping, Frontend Development and Testing. Some of these savings can be reinvested to solve specific challenges for the user and build custom components specific to your product use case.

## Use some or all of our components

Working with scale does not limit your choices: as much as you can use Scale as the basis for all your Product UI Design, you can also choose to only use specific elements in your Frontend.

## Accessibility out of the box

Scale components already fulfil the technical requirements to provide an AA Accessibility Level, making them safe to use for internal and client-facing web development projects.

## Collaboration throughout the Enterprise

Scale enables Designers and Developers to contribute to the community and make both new and improved components available to everyone else who is using Scale.

## Full theming capabilities

Scale enables theming of all its components. Using overwrites or custom themes, styles can be adjusted to your specific product, brand, audience and use case. It can even be used to provide Services for third party brands.
