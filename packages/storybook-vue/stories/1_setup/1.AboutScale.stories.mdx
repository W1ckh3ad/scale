![About Scale](assets/1_setup/1_about-scale/About-Scale.png)

The Scale design system is a new way for teams to design, prototype and build products.

## Production-Ready UI Components for Design and Development

Scale provides matching design assets and frontend code components. This facilitates collaboration between design and development and frees up considerable resources in product design processes.

## Always in Sync

Scale design assets and code components are based on a single source of truth. As a consequence, they are always in sync and up to date. Using the provided default theme, the visual design is approved by Brand and Design.

## Production-Ready on All Frameworks

The Scale design assets are built to work in Sketch while the code components can be used in major frontend frameworks like Vue, React and Angular. Or even as "vanilla" web components. [Learn more about web components.](https://webcomponents.org)

## Enabling Best-Of-Class Experiences

Scale helps save time in UI design, brand alignment, design hand-off, prototyping, frontend development and testing. Some of these savings can be reinvested to solve specific challenges for the user and build custom components matching your individual product use case.

## Use Some or All of Our Components

With Scale the choice is yours: You can either use it as the basis for your entire product UI design or pick specific elements to use in your frontend.

## Accessibility Out of the Box

Scale components fulfil the technical requirements for providing an AA accessibility level, making them safe to use for internal as well as client-facing web development projects.

## Collaboration Throughout the Enterprise

Scale enables designers and developers to contribute to the community and make both new and improved components available to everyone else who is using the design system.

## Full Theming Capabilities

Scale allows theming of all its components. Using overwrites or custom themes, styles can be adjusted to your specific product, brand, audience and use case. You can even use it to provide services for third-party brands.
