(DE)![Scale for Developers](assets/1_setup/3_scale-for-developers/Scale-for-developers.png)

Scale provides frontend developers and engineers with a collection of reusable web components to build websites and user interfaces in major frontend frameworks like Vue, React, Angular and HTML.

Adopting the Scale design system enables developers to use consistent markup, styles and behavior in prototype and production work.

## Setting things up

This repository uses `lerna` and `typescript`

## Running locally

### 1. Clone this repository to a local folder

```bash
cd path-to/folder-name
git clone git@github.com:telekom/scale.git
cd scale
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Before you install any packages, make sure you are logged into your npm account locally. You will also need to be part of the scaleds organization on npm. (For an invitation, please send an email to Egor egor.kirpichev@telekom.de.)

To login to npm use this command and follow the instructions:

```
npm login
```

This repository uses `yarn lerna`, for the symlinks to work correctly we use `yarn` in favour of `npm`

```bash
yarn bootstrap
```

### 3. Build packages

```bash
# build
yarn build
```

## NPM registry

As stated above, you need to be part of the @scaleds organization on npm (npmjs.org) in order to be able to install and use our packages.

If you are not yet part of if, please send Egor an e-mail requesting an invitation. egor.kirpichev@telekom.de

Thank you.

## App development

When using the Scale components for app development, the only thing you need is to be logged in on npm via the terminal.

To log, in please issue the following command:

```bash
npm login
```

and follow the prompt's instructions.

Then you should be able to install any @scaleds/\* package in your project.

## CI

RRegardless of what CI platform/technology you use, the system must be able to access the @scaleds/\* packages used in your application.

Thus, you will need these three things:

1.	a membership in the @scaleds organization on npm,
2.	an authorization token from one of the @scaleds owners, and
3.	a .npmrc file referencing the authorization token, which ideally should be securely stored in an ENV variable.


> Note: this may vary depending on your CI Pipeline

### .npmrc

use this file to easily constrain a set of npm-related configurations to a project. In this case, we use it to set up the authorization token so the system can access the packages without requiring a particular user to be logged in.

_Example:_

```bash
# CI $ENV
#
# ENV variable defined securely somewhere in your CI service/system
# name: $NPM_TOKEN
# value: 52E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E252E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E252E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E2
#
# The value should be the authorization token you got from the @scaleds organisation owner!!!
#


#.npmrc

registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
//registry.npmjs.org/:always-auth=true

```

> WARNING: The use of an ENV variable is indispensable, because you don't want to store any sensitive information inside the .npmrc file which could be accidentally pushed to the repository for others to see.

With this setup, the system can log in to npm and access to the packages. In case you need any help, do not hesitate to contact us.
