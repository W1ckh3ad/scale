# Setting things up

As stated in the Getting Started section you need to be part of the @scaleds
organization on npm (npmjs.org) in order to be able to install and use our packages.

If you are not part of the @scaleds organization on npm, please send Egor an
e-mail requesting an invitation. egor.kirpichev@telekom.de

Thank you.

## Local Development

For local development the only thing you need to be able to use the packages
is to be logged in on npm via terminal.

To log in please issue the following command:

```bash
npm login
```

and follow the prompt's instructions.

If all went well, you should be able to install any @scaleds/\* package.

## CI

Regardless of what CI platform / tech / service you use, the system will also
need to be able to access the @scaleds/\* packages used in your application.

For this you will need three things.

1. Be part of the @scaleds organization on npm.
2. An authorization token issued by one of the @scalds organization's owners.
3. An .npmrc file referencing the auth token which should ideally be securely stored in an ENV variable.

> INFO: This may vary depending on your CI Pipeline

### .npmrc

This file is used to easily constrain a set of npm related configurations to a project.
In this case we use it to set up the authorisation token so the system can access the packages without a particular user having to be logged in.

_Example:_

```bash
# CI $ENV
#
# ENV variable defined securely somewhere in your CI service/system
# name: $NPM_TOKEN
# value: 52E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E252E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E252E34D4314AF486C535D5A29CA9E2
#
# The value should be the Auth token you got from the @scaleds organisation owner!!!
#


#.npmrc

registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=$NPM_TOKEN
//registry.npmjs.org/:always-auth=true

```

> WARNING: The use of an ENV variable is indispensable since you don't want any sensitive information stored inside the .npmrc file which could be accidentally pushed to the repository for others to see!

With this setup the system will be able to login itself to npm and gain access to the packages.
In case you need any help, dont't hesitate in contacting us.
