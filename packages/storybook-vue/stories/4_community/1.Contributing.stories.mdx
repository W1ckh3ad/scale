## Development workflow for contributions  
&nbsp;


### Pull requests

When opening a new MR it is advised to branch off the latest `master` branch. We loosely follow the `Git flow` standards for branch naming e.g. `feat|feature`, `fix`, `chore`, `test` etc. All pull requests are then merged into `master` and released through the `CI` pipeline via the `release` branch.

### Tests

When developing new features or components it is required to provide `unit tests` and `end to end` tests if appropriate and aim at 100% test coverage. In addition we use `screenshot tests` for components via `jest-image-snapshot`. Stencil uses `Jest` as the testing framework, please take a look at the existing components as an example or visit the official documentation:

- https://jestjs.io/

### Tooling

We strongly recommend you use the `VSCode text editor` since most of our code is written in `Typescript` and it offers amazing support for the language.
