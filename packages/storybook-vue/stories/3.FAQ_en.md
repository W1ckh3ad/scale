Here is a list of common questions about Scale, along with practical answers.

## Why does the documentation focus on VUE.js? What about React, Angular, and plain web components?

Web components are compatible with all modern browsers and backwards compatible through polyfills. For more information visit [webcomponents.org](https://webcomponents.org).

## We have our own design system. Why not use that?

At the project level, there are several design systems to serve project requirements; Scale addresses the requirements at an enterprise level. While you can probably use your own system along with Scale, we recommend you use a custom theme from Scale and add your own components as needed.

Using Scale is currently voluntary. We work hard to provide access to everyone who needs it.

## How often will you release updates to the design system?

We are planning for regular iterations, bugfixes, and feature releases.
