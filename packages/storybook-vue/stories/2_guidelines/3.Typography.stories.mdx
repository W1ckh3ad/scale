# Typography

Typography can help create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through a product or experience.

## General

In addition to our color and logo, the TeleNeo font is a central design element that ensures recognition. We use our company font, TeleNeo, across all products and media in order to shape the customer experience over time. In addition to the basic usage principles in liquid design, you will also find tips and tricks for using the font. We explain the differences between the OpenType font, the Office version, and the possibilities for the variable font, as well as offering them for download. Typography is one of our fixed design elements

## Principles

**1. We use our typeface TeleNeo for every written word.**

**2. Our typography colors are always Magenta, white or black.**

**3. We adjust our variable font to the requirements of touch points.**

## Font styles

TeleNeo has five font styles that are evenly graded in font weight; each is also available in italics.

- TeleNeo Thin
- TeleNeo Regular

### Text hierarchy

Clearly distinguishable font hierarchies give users orientation and make important information directly visible. In addition to typefaces, important ways of differentiating include sizes, colors, and spellings.
