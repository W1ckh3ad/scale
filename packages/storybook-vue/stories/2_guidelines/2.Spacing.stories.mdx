# Spacing

Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. Scale takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver clear, functional layouts.

## Spacing Scale

Use the spacing units when building individual components. They include small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level designs.

| ---------- | ----- | --- | --------------------------------------- |

## Layout Scale

The layout units arrange components and other UI parts into a full page layout. Their larger increments are used to control the density of a design. Use the smaller layout tokens to create dense compositions and direct relationships. Use the larger tokens to increase the amount of white space and to disassociate sections.

## Designing With Space

Every part of a UI — including the empty space between elements — should be intentional. The amount of space between items creates relationships and hierarchy.

### Creating Relationships

Elements that are near each other are considered meaningfully related. As more space is added between elements, their perceived relationship weakens.

Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships. Elements arranged in the same spacing pattern are seen as related pieces that have equal weight.

Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information. This creates content sections on a page without having to use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.

### Creating Hierarchy

Elements that are given more space tend to be perceived as higher in importance than elements with less space Take this page for instance: The top level headers have more space around them, which gives them focus and prominence. Then, as the headers descend in importance, they receive less space, which signals that they are subordinate.

Elements that are set close to each other can easily be overlooked. While users may be aware of the grouping, they may not process each individual item. Therefore, if you have an element or content of high importance on the page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it attract focus.

### White Space

Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on certain elements. White space also helps with information processing, since too much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user. Individual sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should never be crowded; there should always be some white space to give the user’s eye some rest.
