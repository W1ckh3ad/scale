# Spacing

Spacing is an important — and often overlooked — part of visual design. Scale takes a lot of the guesswork out of spacing to help designers deliver clear, functional layouts.

## Spacing Scale

Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes small increments needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level designs.

| name       | rem   | px  | example                                 |
| ---------- | ----- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| Spacing-01 | 0,375 | 6   | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-31-16.png) |
| Spacing-02 | 0,5   | 8   | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-27-47.png) |
| Spacing-03 | 0,75  | 12  | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-27-54.png) |
| Spacing-04 | 1,5   | 24  | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-28-1.png)  |

## Layout Scale

The layout scale is used for arranging components and other UI parts into a full page layout. It has larger increments that are used to control the density of a design. Use the smaller layout tokens to create more dense compositions and direct relationships. Use the larger tokens to increase the amount of white space and to disassociate sections.

| name      | rem | px  | example                                 |
| --------- | --- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| Layout-01 | 1   | 16  | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-31-28.png) |
| Layout-02 | 1,5 | 24  | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-29-47.png) |
| Layout-03 | 2   | 32  | ![](/assets/image2020-8-3_13-29-54.png) |

## Designing with space

Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space between elements. The amount of space between items creates relationships and hierarchy.

### Creating relationships

Elements in a design that are near each other are seen as being meaningfully related. As more space is added between elements, their perceived relationship weakens.

Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships. Elements arranged in the same spacing pattern are seen as related pieces that have equal weight.

Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information. This creates content sections on a page without having to use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.

### Creating hierarchy

Elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as higher in importance than elements that have less space around them. Take this page for instance. The top level headers have more space surrounding them giving them focus and prominence. Then as the headers descend in importance they receive less space, signaling they are subordinate.

Elements that are set close to each other can be easily overlooked. Users may see the grouping but not process each individual item. Therefore, if you have an element or content of high importance on the page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it attract focus.

### White space

Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can be used to break up sections on a page or to help create focus on certain element(s). White space helps with information processing; too much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a user. Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should not be crowded; there should be white space to let the user’s eye rest.
