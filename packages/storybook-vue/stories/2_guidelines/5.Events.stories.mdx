# Events

In order to prevent collisions with standard events and compatibility with other libraries and frameworks, 
some components of `Scale` are using custom event names.
You can find documentation for the custom events on the respective component pages in the `docs` section.


## React

Events are prefixed with: `Scale{EventName}`

## Angular / Vue

Events are prefixed with: `scale-{event-name}`
