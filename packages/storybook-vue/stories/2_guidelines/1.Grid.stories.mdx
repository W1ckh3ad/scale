# Grid

The grid is fundamental to everything we design. The grid is the geometric foundation of all the visual elements, from typography to columns, boxes, icons, and illustrations. It provides structure and guidance for all creative decision-making.

## Base Unit

The basic unit of our grid is the 8-pixel square base unit. Multiples of base units compose the dimensions of columns, rows, boxes, along with their margins and padding. The base unit adapts to your content while maintaining a consistent visual rhythm.
