# Design Tokens

The heart of the Scale Design System is a set of design tokens. They're a limited set of key/value pairs organized in categories.

The Scale components are built using the tokens to make sure they stick to Brand & Design and remain consistent.

The design tokens are available independently from the core component library, in CSS and JavaScript formats, so you can use them in your own components.

## Working with tokens

Tokens are available as CSS variables, prefixed with `scl`.

They're also available as named exports to use in JavaScript (CSS-in-JS).

To use the tokens, import them from the `@scaleds/design-tokens-telekom` package

- `@scaleds/design-tokens-telekom/dist/design-tokens-telekom.css` for **CSS**
- `@scaleds/design-tokens-telekom/dist/design-tokens-telekom.js` for **JavaScript** (or CSS-in-JS)

The source is also available in the src/ folder.

## Font formatting

To style text in your project, there are a few CSS helper classes:

| application   | CSS class name                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Heading 01    | .scl-font-variant-heading-1    |
| Heading 02    | .scl-font-variant-heading-2    |
| Heading 03    | .scl-font-variant-heading-3    |
| Heading 04    | .scl-font-variant-heading-4    |
| Heading 05    | .scl-font-variant-heading-5    |
| Heading 06    | .scl-font-variant-heading-6    |
| Body large    | .scl-font-variant-body-large   |
| Body long     | .scl-font-variant-body         |
| Body short    | .scl-font-variant-body-short   |

Simply use them in your HTML:

```html
<h1 class="scl-font-variant-heading-1">Typography</h1>
```
