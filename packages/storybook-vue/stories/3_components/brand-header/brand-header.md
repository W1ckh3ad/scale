# Brand Header

The brand header allows users to clearly identify Telekom as the sender of a page. It contains the navigation elements for the first level information architecture.

## Elements Brandbar

The magenta part of the header clearly signifies Telekom as the author of the page.

### Telekom Logo (1)

The logo, claim and magenta background are mandatory for any Telekom page and cannot be changed. The logo should always link to the products / websites, the homepage or the entry point to the current process.

### Private / Business Switch (2)

If your product includes specific versions for private and business clients, use this element to link to the respective start pages. An underline marks the current page as active.

### Brand Links (3)

Other relevant links to Telekom destinations outside the current product are placed here.

### Language Switch (4)

With the language switch, users can select the desired language of the website.

## Language Switch Variants

### Plain Text Links

If there is enough space, the language options can be placed as text links side by side.

### Dropdown

If there is not enough space in combination with other brand links, the language options should be displayed as a dropdown.

## Elements Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is where users reliably find the most important navigation elements of your page or product. For a good responsive experience, any item in the main navigation and navigation icon bar is either a direct link to a new page or an opening drawer.

### Primary Navigation (1)

This is where the first level navigation / IA of your product lives.

### Secondary Navigation (2)

This area contains labeled icons for global functionality: 1. search, 2. shopping cart, 3. login and 4. menu (for tablet and mobile). In case you need another functionality, add it before or after position 2 (shopping cart).

## Navigation List Variants

For displaying categories on a desktop, decide for one version of the navigation list. Both desktop variants render to the same mobile navigation pattern.

### Dropdown

The dropdown navigation can accomodate unlimited levels of navigation and different depths inside a navigation tree. As a general rule, the less levels the better.

### Mega Menu

The mega menu provides a greater overview within a category, but is limited to a maximum of three navigation levels.

## Mobile Navigation

All mobile navigation sits inside a "menu" drawer and contains all elements from the desktop navigation.

### Navigation closed (1)
### Navigation open (2)
### Navigation level 3 (3)

## Best Practice

### Implications for Information Architecture

- Always label the first item in the navigation bar with your product name to enable better orientation for the user.
- Every navigation element can be either a link or a category containing further links.

#### Information Architecture Example

Blue categories display the unterlying navigation hierarchy, but never link to a page. A clear division between the functions "category" and "link" enables consistent behavior throughout all responsive breakpoints and keeps navigation consistent for the user at all times.
