# Link

Links are used as navigational elements. They may appear on their own, within a sentence or paragraph or directly following content.

## General

Links provide a lightweight option for navigation. Like other interactive elements, too many links will clutter a page and make it difficult for users to identify their next steps. This holds especially true for inline links, which should be used sparingly.

### When to Use

Use links when you want users to:

- Navigate to a different page within the application
- Navigate to an entirely different site
- Jump to an element on the same page
- Link to emails or phone numbers

### When Not to Use:

Whenever you want users to perform actions that will either change data or manipulate the way it is displayed, change a state or trigger an action, use a button instead.

## Variants

### Text Only

We recommend links with three words or less. Because links take users to a new location, it is important that their labels accurately reflect the content users will find there. Therefore, use meaningful labels and avoid terms like “click here” or the web address itself.

Links need to be clear enough for the user to understand, but short enough to avoid that the text wraps onto the next line — unless it is an inline link.

### Text & Icons

Icons can be added to links in order to highlight certain categories, e.g. links to external sites, to documents, to downloads etc. Make sure to use link icons consistently throughout your product.
