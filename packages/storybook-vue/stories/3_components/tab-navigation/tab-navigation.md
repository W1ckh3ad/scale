# Tab Navigation

Tabs allow users to navigate easily between views within the same context.

## General

Each tab should contain content that is distinct from other tabs in a set. For example, tabs can present different sections of news, different genres of music or different themes of documents.

## Basic Types

### Text Only

For most use cases, tabs with text provide the best guidance.

### Text & Icon

An icon can be added to further increase the user's understanding of what is to be found within a certain tab. Do not use the same icon in more than one tab within a group.

### Icon Only

When space is limited, you may choose tabs with only an icon. Note that the icon must unambiguously describe the functionality of the tab.

## Elements

### Label

The label is the most important element on a tab, as it communicates which content will become visible upon clicking.

## Sizes

## Best Practice

### Consistent Types

Do not use both icons and text labels on only some tabs, but not on others.

### Icons Only

Be aware that icons only may not clearly convey the tab content. Different users may interpret icons differently.
