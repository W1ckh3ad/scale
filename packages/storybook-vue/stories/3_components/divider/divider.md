# Divider

A divider is a thin line that separates content into groups. This way coherent content is more identifiable to the user.

## Variants

## Best Practice

### Subtle

Dividers should be noticeable in a layout, but not jarring.

### Secondary

Dividers should only be used if separating elements through white space is not enough.

### Infrequent

Use dividers sparingly, to create groupings rather than separate items.
