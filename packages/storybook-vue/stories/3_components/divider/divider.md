# Divider

A divider is a thin line that helps divide elements into groups. This makes it easy for users to identify content that belongs together.

## General

Dividers have a subtle visual effect â€“ visible but never dominant.

### When to use

Only use a divider when there is not enough whitespace to clearly form groups of content. For instance:

*	when there are too many elements to group in the available whitespace or
*	when there is almost no whitespace available to group content together.

### When not to use

Only use a divider when really necessary. To avoid clutter and fragmentation, use as few dividers as possible.
