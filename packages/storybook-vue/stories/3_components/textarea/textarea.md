# Textarea

With a text area, users can enter long text in a form.

## General

### When to Use

Use text area whenever users should be able to enter a larger amount of text. Examples: comments or notes on an order, a message in a contact form.

### When Not to Use

For simple text input that does not require multiple lines, use an input filed instead.

### Label (1)

Clearly label your text area so users know which information to enter. e.g. "notes".

### Placeholder Text (2) (Optional)

An example text that is displayed on focus when no input has been entered yet, e.g. "your message".

### Info (3)

Optional instructions about the field, e.g. "this will not be shared with your contacts".

### Character Count (4) (Optional)

Limit the amount of characters for a text area. When a limit is set, a counter is displayed e.g. "14/75".

### Error / Improve / Required Input (5) (Optional)

Error text can be set to highlight the changes a user has to make for the information to validate. e.g. "please enter a valid e-mail adress". The error text overwrites the information notes, if present.

For required fields, use this flag to display the corresponding information and validate the form accordingly.

### Resize (6) (Optional)

With this element, the user can adjust the size of the text field to make the entire text visible.
