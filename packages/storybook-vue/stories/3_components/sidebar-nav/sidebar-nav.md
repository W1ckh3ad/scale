# Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar navigation complements the main navigation in an extensive information architecture. It helps users quickly find content within an area of the website.

## General

Using the sidebar navigation is optional. It offers the option of mapping secondary navigation with up to three levels of hierarchy. The sidebar navigation is visible on all pages within an area of the site.

### When to use

* your secondary navigation contains more than seven menu items or
* the secondary navigation of an area should always be visible.


### When not to use

* the main navigation can easily map all hierarchy levels.

An example of the sidebar navigation for desktop

### First level of hierarchy (1)

The first level of hierarchy can have a submenu or link. If it's a submenu, hovering over it displays an arrow.

### Second level of hierarchy (2)

The same applies to the second level of hierarchy: it can also have a submenu or link.

### Third level of hierarchy (3)

The third level of hierarchy only has links.

### Current page (4)

A Magenta font designates the current page.

### Icon (5)

The arrow appears during a mouse over. After clicking on the submenu, it remains visible and changes its orientation to indicate that the submenu is open.

### Divider (6)

Navigation points from the first and second level of hierarchy are separated by a divider below the navigation points.

## Sidebar navigation on small devices

Small devices don't show the sidebar navigation on the left, but instead above the page content. By default, it is closed.
By tapping on an upstream level of hierarchy, users open a list view with entries from the first level of hierarchy.
Depending on the number of levels, users can navigate through further lists to reach the desired content.
Since there is no mouse over on mobile devices, the arrow of a submenu is always visible.
