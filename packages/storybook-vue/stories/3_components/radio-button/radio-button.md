### When  to Use

Whenever only one selection of a group is allowed, use the radio button component.

### When Not to Use

Whenever the user should be able to select several options at once, use checkboxes instead.

## Elements

### Label

Clearly label your radio buttons so users know what option they select e.g. "daily / weekly / monthly".

## Best Practice

### Default Selection

On option within a set of radio buttons should be selected by default when the page is loaded. Never display a group of radio buttons without a default selection.
