# Button

Buttons allow the user to identify and execute actions on a page.

## General

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

### When to Use

Use buttons to communicate the most important actions a user can take.

### When Not to Use

Do not use buttons for navigation. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

Only use buttons as navigational elemens if navigation is the single most important use case, like the link to a product landing page.

## Basic Types

Each viewport should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be displayed as lower emphasis buttons.

### Primary

For the most important call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header or in a modal dialog). They are used for the actions most relevant to the user. The primary button must not be used for negative actions such as "delete".

### Secondary

The secondary button is less prominent than the call to action and used for all other actions a user might want to perform.


## Variants

### Text Only

For most use cases, buttons with text provide the best guidance.

### Text & Icon

An icon can be added to further increase the user's recognition of the action the button will execute.

### Icon Only

When space is limited — e.g. in function bars or contextual interactions — buttons with only an icon can be used. Note that the icon must clearly and unambiguously describe the functionality (e.g. trash bin for "delete").

## Sizes

### Large

Use the large button as a default.

### Small

Use when there is not enough vertical space for the large button.

## Elements

### Label

The text label of a button is its most important element, as it communicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it. Buttons need to be clear and predictable. Therefore, button labels should unambiguously indicate the action of the button. To provide enough context, use the {verb} + {noun} content formula on buttons except in the case of common actions like “Done”, “Close”, “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete.”

Even for icon-only buttons, always provide a label to use in screen readers.

### Icon

Use an icon to facilitate grasping the button function or for design reasons. Make sure you use icons consistently in the interface.

## Best Practice

### Combining Buttons

Button groups are a useful way of aligning buttons that have a relationship. Group the buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance. When combining buttons, use no more than one call to action in the group.

### Alignment

In single page forms, buttons are left-aligned with the form content. The button most to the left can be a call to action. In processes and on modals, buttons are right-aligned. The one most to the right can be a call to action.
