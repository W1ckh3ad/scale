# Checkbox

With checkboxes, users select and deselect single options in a form.

## General

Checkboxes are used for multiple choice situations. Each checkbox works independently of the other checkboxes, therefore checking an additional checkbox does not affect other selections. Checkboxes can be selected and deselected by clicking either the box or the corresponding label.

### When to Use

**Forms**<br>
Checkboxes can be used in forms on a full page, in modals or on side panels.

**Filtering and Batch Action**<br>
They can be used to filter data either on a page, in a menu or within a component.

**Terms and Conditions**<br>
Selecting or deselecting the checkbox can indicate whether you agree to the terms.

### When Not to Use

If you want the user to choose only one mandatory option from a list, use radio buttons instead.

## Elements

### Label

Give checkboxes clear labels so users know what they are selecting or deselecting e.g. "Sign up for the Newsletter".

### Required Input / Improve

When checking a box is required, use this flag to display the corresponding information and validate the form accordingly.
