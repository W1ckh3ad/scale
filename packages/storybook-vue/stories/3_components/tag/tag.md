# Chip

Chips help users to percieve and identify tags and categories assigned to objects in the product. By default, chips are not interactive.

## General

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections or filter content. Chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements.

### When to Use

Use chips when content is mapped to multiple categories and the user needs a way to differentiate between them. Chips can also be used as a method of filtering data, to show only items within a particular category.

## Basic Types

### Static

For display only.

## Colors

Use a default color or assign a custom color. When customizing, use a color-coding scheme that is clear and supports the user in what they want to achieve.

## Elements

### Label

The label clearly describes what the chip stands for. Use a maximum of three words.

### Remove Icon (Optional)

When users can manually remove tags or categories, an X - icon can be added to the chip. Clicking on it removes the tag from its assigned object.
