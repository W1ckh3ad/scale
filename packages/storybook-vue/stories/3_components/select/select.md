### Label (1)

Clearly label your select boxes so users know the context of their list of options, e.g. "country".

### Info (2) (Optional)

An additional info text may be useful to communicate the content or purpose of the presented options more clearly.

### Error / Improve / Required Selection (3) (Optional)

When a selection is required, use this flag to display the corresponding information and validate the form accordingly.

### Option Group (4) (Optional)

Related options can be grouped together. The group should be labelled in a way that the content of the group can be derived e.g. "europe".

### Options (5)

Selectable options inside a select box e.g. "germany, france, belgium".

## Sizes

### Large

Use large select boxes as the default option. Combine with other large form elements like input or button.
