# Slider

Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content. The user can increase or decrease a value by moving the handle along a horizontal track.

## General

Sliders allow users to view and select a value from a given range along a bar. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume and brightness or for applying filters. Changes made with sliders are immediate, allowing users to make adjustments while determining their selection. Sliders should not be used for settings where user feedback comes with delay.

## Elements

In its basic form, the slider is accompanied by a label and a number displaying the current value.

## Colors

Use the default color or assign a custom color. When customizing, use a color-coding scheme that is clear to the user and supports them in their use cases.

## Best Practice

- The slider label should indicate what value the slider is changing.
- Range values are used to describe the range in numbers.
- Do not use for extremely large ranges i.e. 1-1000.
- Do not use for extremely small ranges i.e. 1-3.
