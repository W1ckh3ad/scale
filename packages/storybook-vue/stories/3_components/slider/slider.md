# Slider

A slider lets users control a value or a range of values.

## General

A slider displays the current value or range of values by default. Users can increase or decrease the value or range of values by moving a handle along a bar. Using a slider usually triggers an immediate effect (e.g., adjusting a setting like volume or filtering data).

### When to use

Use a slider when:

- users need to quickly adjust a value,
- adjusting the value or range triggers an immediate effect, or
- the input doesnâ€™t have to be precise.

### When not to use

Don't use a slider when:

- users might want to pick a precise value (here an input field is better),
- there is no immediate effect,
- the range is very large (e.g., more than 1-100), or
- the range is very small (e.g., 1-3).

## Basic types

Each slider needs a label which describes the value that is changing. Always display the current value by default.

## Colors

Telekom sliders use Magenta as an accent color. If you need to apply a color code, you can either use colors from the Telekom color palette or create a custom one. When customizing, use a color-code scheme that is clear to the user and meets all accessibility requirements.
