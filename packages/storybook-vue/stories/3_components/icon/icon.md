# Icon

With icons our customers can easily find their way around our product or page and grasp content and functions quickly.

## General

Our icons fit harmoniously into the design of our websites and apps. They illustrate abstract and complex topics. With our own icon style, we subtly convey the values of the Telekom brand.

## Basic Types

### Static

A static icon has no interactive functionality.
