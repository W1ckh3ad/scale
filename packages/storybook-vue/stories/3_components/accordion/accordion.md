# Accordion

Accordions make it easy for users to get an overview of page content and expand the relevant topics for further exploration. Accordions can hold all types of content.

## General

### When to Use

- To organize related information.
- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when it is not crucial to read content in full.
- When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once, like on a mobile interface.

### Title (1)

The title should be as brief as possible while being clear and descriptive.

Indicates if the panel is open or closed.

#### Body Copy (3)

Content inside of a section may be split into paragraphs and include sub-headers and images if needed. Excessive complexity should, however, be avoided.
