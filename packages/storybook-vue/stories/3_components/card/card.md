# Card

Cards help users perceive and interact with groups of content elements. They contain content and actions about a single subject.

## Basic Types

### Interactive Cards

Cards can be used as a single interactive entity. By clicking a card, the user activates a link.

### Static Cards

Use static cards for the visual grouping of individual elements. Static cards are not interactive themselves, their content is.

## Elements

### Card Padding

By default, cards have an inner layout padding for aligning typography and interactive elements within the card. If you want to use full bleed artwork, turn the padding off.

## Best Practice

### Decide for One Type of Card

Always only use one type of card in a given context, like a screen or a service â€” either interactive or static. Mixing card types confuses users and should therefore be avoided.

### Keep Interactions Clear

When choosing interactive cards, do not add additional interactive elements. Focus on the link functionality only.

### Design Your Own

The card component intentionally gives you flexibility to develop your headers, content and structure as they best fit your product use case.
