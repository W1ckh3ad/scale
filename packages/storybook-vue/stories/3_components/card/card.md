# Card

Cards group related pieces of information together and represent one conceptional unit. They make it easier for users to quickly scan content and find relevant information.

## General

Cards can hold any kind of content in a flexibly sized container. One card communicates one message. A card is an independent piece of content that requires no additional context.

### When to use

Cards are best suited to:

*	encourage and enable users to browse your content (e.g., shop, social media, etc.) or
*	provide summaries of different kinds of content (e.g., dashboards).

### When not to use

Don't use cards:

*	solely for aesthetic reasons or
*	as purely navigational elements.


## Basic types

### Card with an interactive container

The card acts as a preview and point of entry for more detailed information. The card itself is the primary interaction area. Additional interaction elements are not needed. Including additional interactive elements, like buttons or text links, will generate a second action area.

### Card with a static container

A card with a static container also communicates one important message. Generally, no crucial information follows after the card. Although the container is not an interactive component, it can still contain interactive elements like functions or text links to related information.

## Layout

### Card Padding

By default, cards have an inner padding to align typography and visual elements within the card. If you want to place images in the bleed, turn the padding off.

## Best practice

### Decide on one type of card

Decide whether you want to use cards with an interactive or static container in your product or service. Never mix card types, because doing so is confusing for users.

### Be consistent

Display content of the same type (e.g., blogposts, products, or cards) with a uniform structure. This provides a balanced appearance so users can easily compare content.

### Design your own card

You can design cards for a variety of situations. The purpose of the card component is to give you the flexibility to build your card according to our principles â€“ as best suits your particular use case.
