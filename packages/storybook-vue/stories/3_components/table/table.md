### Table Row (1)

Data is organized in rows, each row displaying one object.

### Table Row Hover

For improved readability, table rows can be highlighted through a mouse hover effect.

#### Table Column (2)

Columns hold the same types of data through all displayed objects.

### Table Cell Content (3)

Table cells can contain any type of information or markup.

### Table Header (4)

The table header describes the content of the table columns.

#### Static Header

The default table header is descriptive and has no interactive functionality.

#### Sorting Header

With a sorting header, the objects in the table (organized in table rows) can be sorted by the contents of the respective column. The sorting order can be switched between ascending and descending.

## Mobile

The table structure and presentation are similar on both desktop and mobile. On mobile, horizontal swiping allows for viewing the complete content.

## Best Practice

### Content Alignment

The content of the first column should always be left-aligned. Content within other columns can be aligned left or right. The alignment of the respective table header should be adjusted accordingly.
