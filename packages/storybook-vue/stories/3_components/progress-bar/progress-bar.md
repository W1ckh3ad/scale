# Progress Bar

The progress bar informs users about the status of an ongoing process, such as loading an app, submitting a form or saving updates.

## Basic Types

### Determinate

Determinate indicators display how long a process will take. They should be used when it is possible to define the process completion rate.

### Indeterminate

Indeterminate indicators illustrate an unspecified amount of wait time. They should be used when it is either not possible or not necessary to indicate how long a process will take.
